# AI RULE FILE – CREATING WEBSITE PRICING PLANS

Use these rules whenever you design or generate a pricing section (pricing plans / subscription comparison) on a website.

---

## 1. Goals of the pricing section

1.1. Always optimize for clarity and fast decision-making, not for visual “flashiness”.

1.2. The pricing section must help a visitor answer three questions within a few seconds:

- What are my options?
- What does each option include?
- Which option is probably best for me?

  1.3. The user should always see a clear next step (primary call-to-action button) on every plan.

---

## 2. Number and type of plans

2.1. Default to **2–4 plans** shown side by side on desktop.

- 2 plans: when offerings are very simple (e.g., “Basic vs Premium”).
- 3 plans: most common; allows highlighting a “recommended” middle plan.
- 4 plans: only if plans are genuinely different and easy to explain.

  2.2. Each plan must have:

- A **clear name** (1–3 words).
- A **short descriptor** under the name that says who it is for or what it focuses on (e.g., “For small businesses”, “Taxes only”, “Law + Taxes”).

  2.3. Avoid having more than one plan that looks almost identical. If two plans are very similar, either:

- Merge them, or
- Make the difference very explicit in a short line (e.g., “Includes legal support” vs “Tax support only”).

---

## 3. Layout and structure

3.1. Use a **horizontal card layout** on desktop:

- Section title at the top (e.g., “Choose the plan that fits you”).
- Plan cards displayed in a row, centered on the page.
- Each card has consistent width and padding.

  3.2. For mobile:

- Stack cards vertically.
- Keep call-to-action visible without long scrolling inside a single card (avoid overly long lists before the button).

  3.3. Each plan card must follow the same structure in this order:

1. Plan name
2. Optional short label/tag (e.g., “Most popular”, “Recommended”).
3. Price line.
4. Billing and tax information.
5. Primary call-to-action button.
6. Short divider or spacing.
7. Feature/benefit list (bullets).
8. Any legal notes or disclaimers in smaller text.

---

## 4. Price display rules

4.1. Always show:

- **Main price** in large, clear text.
- **Billing period** (e.g., “per month”, “per year”) directly next to or below the price.
- **Tax information** (e.g., “net”, “+ VAT”, or “incl. VAT”) close to the price.

  4.2. Use the same **currency** and **format** across all plans in one section.

  4.3. If there is a “from” price (e.g., “from 699 zł”):

- Make clear that it is a starting point and that the final price depends on conditions (e.g., company size, extra services).
- Avoid misleading promises: do not use “from” if 90% of clients will pay much more.

  4.4. If discounts apply (e.g., yearly vs monthly):

- Show both prices clearly.
- Indicate savings in a short badge or line (e.g., “Save 15% with yearly billing”).

---

## 5. Call-to-action (CTA) buttons

5.1. Every plan must have **one primary CTA** button. Examples:

- “Choose plan”
- “Start now”
- “Book consultation”
- “Order package”

  5.2. CTA text must describe the action, not be generic. Avoid “Click here”.

  5.3. Use a **consistent CTA label** across all plans if they perform the same action.

  5.4. Make the button visually prominent:

- High contrast versus card background.
- Sufficient padding and width (easy to tap on mobile).

  5.5. If one plan is recommended, you may:

- Use a stronger button style (filled) on that card.
- Use a lighter or outlined style on others.

---

## 6. “Recommended” / “Most popular” plan

6.1. Prefer to highlight **one** plan as “Recommended” or “Most popular”.

6.2. Visual emphasis rules:

- Slightly larger card or subtle shadow.
- Badge/label near the top (e.g., “Most popular”).
- Button style can be more eye-catching, but still consistent with the global design.

  6.3. The recommended plan must **objectively make sense** (good value, most common choice). Never highlight a plan that is clearly bad value.

---

## 7. Feature and benefit lists

7.1. Use bullet points for plan content. Structure:

- **1–2 top bullets**: strongest benefits in plain language (what outcomes the client gets).
- **3–7 bullets total** per plan. Avoid very long lists.

  7.2. Each bullet must be:

- Short (ideally one line).
- Specific (avoid vague terms like “full support” without detail).
- Written from client’s perspective, focusing on what they get or what problem is solved.

  7.3. Use consistent bullet order across plans:

- Start with consulting/support access.
- Then expertise/analysis scope.
- Then extras (webinars, templates, reports).

  7.4. If certain features exist only in higher plans:

- Mark them clearly in those plans.
- Do not silently remove them from cheaper plans; make the difference visible (either via checkmarks or by stating “Not included” in comparisons).

---

## 8. Text and language guidelines

8.1. Tone:

- Professional, clear, and confident.
- Avoid jargon unless it is common for the target audience (e.g., specific tax/legal terms).

  8.2. Headline of the section (e.g., “Choose the right plan for you”) must:

- Explain what the section is about.
- Encourage choice rather than confuse.

  8.3. Use **plain, direct sentences**. Examples:

- “Unlimited tax consultations by email.”
- “We check if you can pay less tax and suggest legal options.”
- “Access to knowledge base and document templates.”

  8.4. Avoid fear-based or overly aggressive wording in pricing sections. Any mention of risks (e.g., penalties, audits) should be factual, not emotional.

  8.5. For local markets, adapt:

- Language (Polish/English/other).
- Legal/tax terminology.
- Currency and decimal separators.

---

## 9. Visual design and hierarchy

9.1. Use a **clear hierarchy**:

- Section title largest.
- Plan names smaller than title but larger than body text.
- Price slightly larger than plan name.
- Features and disclaimers in regular text size; legal fine print slightly smaller.

  9.2. Background and contrast:

- Use a background that allows easy reading (e.g., dark card on darker background, with enough contrast; or light card on light page).
- Text must always pass basic readability (dark text on light, or light text on dark).

  9.3. Spacing:

- Use generous padding inside cards.
- Maintain equal spacing between elements (name, price, button, list).

  9.4. Icons/checkmarks:

- You may use simple icons (e.g., checkmarks) to reinforce each bullet.
- Icons should be subtle, not distract from text.

  9.5. Keep the style **consistent** with the rest of the site (fonts, colors, button styles), but you may slightly emphasize the pricing section to make it stand out.

---

## 10. Supporting elements around pricing

10.1. Close to the pricing section (above or below), consider including:

- Short FAQ about billing, cancellations, and scope.
- Trust elements: testimonials, client logos, or short proof of expertise.
- Links to detailed terms or legal information (especially for law/tax services).

  10.2. If terms are complex (e.g., different prices by company size), provide:

- A very simple summary in the card.
- A link to “full price list” or “detailed conditions” for those who need all details.

---

## 11. Responsiveness and behavior

11.1. On mobile:

- Cards must be full-width.
- Make sure the price and CTA are visible without excessive scrolling.
- Avoid multi-column feature text; keep each bullet on its own line.

  11.2. Ensure buttons and toggles (e.g., monthly/yearly switch) are easy to tap.

  11.3. If using hover effects on desktop (e.g., raising a card), ensure the design still works without hover on touch devices.

---

## 12. Accessibility and clarity

12.1. Ensure:

- Sufficient contrast between text and background.
- Buttons are clearly labeled by text, not only by color.

  12.2. Do not rely only on color to differentiate recommended plans; also use labels or icons.

  12.3. Avoid extremely small fonts for any information that affects what the customer pays.

---

## 13. Data consistency and honesty

13.1. All prices, taxes, and key conditions must be accurate and consistent with legal terms.

13.2. Never hide mandatory fees or requirements in fine print that contradict the main text.

13.3. If something is “unlimited”, it must be practically unlimited or clearly defined (e.g., “reasonable use policy”).
